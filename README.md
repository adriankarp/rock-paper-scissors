<p>Rock, Paper, Scissors (aka "Ro-Sham-Bo"; janken; "Bato, Bato, Pick"; and "Scissors, Paper, Stone") is a simple hand game with many names and variations. It is played around the world and is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions. In some cases is even played for sport. The rules require that competing players use one hand to form one of three shapes at an agreed-upon time. The person that plays the strongest “object” is the winner of the game. It's that easy! Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game that anybody can play and win. There is no intrinsic advantage to the stronger, older, or more experienced opponent.</p>
